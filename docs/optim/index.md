    **By a programmer for programmers**  
    This course explains least squares optimization, nowadays a simple and well-mastered technology. We show how this simple method can solve a large number of problems that would be difficult to approach in any other way. This course provides a simple, understandable yet powerful tool that most coders can use, in the contrast with other algorithms sharing this paradigm (numerical simulation and deep learning) which are more complex to master.
