Whereas discrete objects can often be characterized by integers, continuous objects require real numbers.</p> <p>The study of how discrete objects combine with one another and the probabilities of various outcomes is known as combinatorics. Other fields of mathematics that are considered to be part of discrete mathematics include graph theory and the theory of computation. Topics in number theory such as congruences and recurrence relations are also considered part of discrete mathematics.</p> <p>The study of topics in discrete mathematics usually includes the study of algorithms, their implementations, and efficiencies.
